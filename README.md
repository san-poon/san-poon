## Hello you :wave:, I'm Sanjib Poon!
- ðŸ‘€ I'm curious about *how human learns* and how we could enhance this ability to learn, and am in the processs of developing softwares to do so.
The obvious next step for human beings seems the **symbiosis between Human and AI(Artificial Intelligence)** which I am extremely interested in.
- ðŸŒ± Am proficient in :
  - `HTML5/CSS`
  - `CLI`, `Git/GitHub`
  - `JavaScript`, 
  - `React.js`
  - `Node/Express.js`.
