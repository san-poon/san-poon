## Hello you 👋, I'm Sanjib Poon!

- 👀 I'm curious about _how human learns_ and how we could enhance this ability to learn, and am in the processs of developing softwares to do so.
  The obvious next step for human beings seems to be the **symbiosis between Human and AI** which I am extremely interested in.
- 🌲 Am proficient in :
  - `HTML5/CSS`
  - `CLI`, `Git/GitHub`
  - `JavaScript`,
  - `React.js`
  - `Next.js`
  - `TailwindCSS`

- 🌱 Am familiar with:
  - `Android App Development`
